# iOS-PushViewController-Demo

This project basically tells us how to open a new controller , in a Navigation Controller, using pushViewController method.
It also tells us how to pass data from first controller to second controller.

For how to communicate from first to second comntroller and vice-versa , read this -> https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-pass-data-between-two-view-controllers
